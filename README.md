# LSB
LSB classical algorithm for watermarking
you can just run embed.m file to have the similarity result.
information capacity is defined as: (number of watermark pixels)/(number of total cover image pixels)
similarity is calculated as: if the pixels value of decoded watermark at (x,y) shares the same value with that of original watermark, then set 1; otherwise, set 0.
